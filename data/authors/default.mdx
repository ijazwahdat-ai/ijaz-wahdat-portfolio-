I am a passionate **AI Agent Engineer** based in Kabul, specializing in **Generative AI**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Enterprise Automation**.

My mission is to modernize Afghanistan's telecommunication services through intelligent automation. Recently, at the **Ministry of Communications and IT (MCIT)**, I **engineered and fine-tuned** Afghanistan's first domain-specific AI Agent. I personally developed the entire pipeline from data curation to model deployment for evaluation, enabling the system to understand complex telecom queries for AWCC, MTN, Etisalat, Salaam, Roshan and MCIT.
